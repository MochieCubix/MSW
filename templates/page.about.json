A passion for detail and a love for color & embroidery. Amany & Reem spent their adolescent years surrounded by all things fashion, where they found that this is where their passion lies. Before My Secret Wardrobe came to life, Amany already had years of experience in the fashion industry working for many high-end Australian designers. Reem had already owned a women's boutique and was driven to be an entrepreneur at such a young age.<br\/><br\/>Together with their love for fashion, Amany & Reem saw an opportunity to bring their experience together by helping women feel beautiful in clothing they can afford. So, they set out to explore the world together to seek more knowledge and network. In their travels, they were successful in finding unique designs, test samples, and, more importantly, the right suppliers to partner with.<br\/><br\/>Sisters Amany & Reem founded My Secret Wardrobe in Sydney in 2015, starting with 12 gowns. Over the years, MSW maintained great relationships with suppliers to perfect products & designs and brought in many beautiful gowns available to hire at an affordable price.<br\/><br\/>Amany & Reem continued to educate themselves over the years through study in Creative Fashion Design & Styling, which pushed the two sisters to begin custom making nationally in Australia for clients.<br\/><br\/>In 2019, the sisters launched their first line 'Maldina' through skilled craftsmanship of artisans. Each piece is designed with elegance, sophistication, and confidence.<br\/><br\/>My Secret Wardrobe is the first dress hire store to allow their clients to have the chance to design their own gown made to hire at an affordable price.<br\/><br\/>The two sisters are continuously experimenting with traditional techniques to evolve the MSW brand with a unique footprint.<\/p>","btntxt":"Read More","btnurl":"","btn-style":"btn","width":"100%","alignment":"center","align_text":"center","eblock_bg":false,"block_bg":"#f5f5f5","block_txt":"#000000"}},"eed07140-f1a1-4718-94f4-94e32ccb2103":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"","font-size":"small","text":"<p>Avon comes with easy-to-use interface and outstanding support.
